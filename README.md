# Sensor-Based LED Control System

## Overview

This project involves using two sensors—a relay and a light sensor—to control an LED based on specific conditions. The system detects whether there is movement and the presence of light, and it performs the following actions:

- **Movement without Light**: Turns on the LED.
- **Movement with Light**: Turns off the LED.
- **No Movement with Light**: Turns off the LED.
- **No Movement without Light**: Turns off the LED.

All sensor data and LED states are saved in a database for record-keeping and analysis.

## Components

- **Relay**: Controls the power to the LED.
- **Light Sensor**: Detects the presence or absence of light.
- **LED**: Indicates the state based on sensor input.

## System Requirements

- **Microcontroller/Platform**: ESP32 (or similar)
- **Sensors**: Light sensor (e.g., LDR)
- **Actuator**: Relay module
- **Database**: MySQL (or similar)

## Setup

1. **Hardware Connections**:
    - Connect the light sensor to the ESP32.
    - Connect the relay module to the ESP32 to control the LED.
    - Connect the LED to the relay module.

2. **Software Setup**:
    - Install necessary libraries for sensor and relay control.
    - Configure the microcontroller code to read from the light sensor and control the relay based on the conditions outlined.

3. **Database Configuration**:
    - Set up a MySQL database to store sensor readings and LED states.
    - Ensure that your microcontroller is connected to the database for logging data.

## Code

Here's a brief overview of the code logic:

1. Read the light sensor value.
2. Check if movement is detected (using an appropriate sensor or method).
3. Determine the LED state based on the light sensor value and movement detection.
4. Control the relay to turn the LED on or off accordingly.
5. Save the sensor readings and LED state to the database.

```cpp
// Example code snippet

#include <Wire.h>
#include <LightSensor.h>
#include <RelayModule.h>
#include <Database.h>

// Initialize sensors and relay
LightSensor lightSensor;
RelayModule relay;
Database db;

void setup() {
    // Initialize serial communication
    Serial.begin(115200);

    // Set up sensors and relay
    lightSensor.begin();
    relay.begin();
    db.connect();
}

void loop() {
    bool lightDetected = lightSensor.readLight() > LIGHT_THRESHOLD;
    bool movementDetected = detectMovement(); // Implement movement detection

    if (movementDetected) {
        if (!lightDetected) {
            relay.turnOn(); // Turn on LED
        } else {
            relay.turnOff(); // Turn off LED
        }
    } else {
        relay.turnOff(); // Ensure LED is off
    }

    // Log data to the database
    db.saveData(lightDetected, movementDetected, relay.getState());

    delay(1000); // Delay before the next read
}
```

## Database Schema

The database should have a table to store the sensor data and LED state:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    light_detected BOOLEAN,
    movement_detected BOOLEAN,
    led_state BOOLEAN
);
```
